# WSLControl

I use this for modifying phones in call manager through python. I just import WSLControl from my script and run the functions from there. You will need to modify the WSLControl.py file to work with your call manager server and download the AXL toolkit directly from that server. If you update call manager, you will need to download this toolkit again. 

I also use this in conjuction with cupi for modifying/creating voicemail accounts
